# Day X Day

Day by Day Agenda is an app for small businesses to use as a platform. Youll be able to sign up as either a User or Customer, defining how you use the app. You'll be able to connect with one another, schedule appointments, and leave reviews of your experience.

# Update
Currently the app is offline. This repository will be left here for purposes of showing my skills I have learned. It also serves as a reminder of the mistakes I made along the way, and how much I have grown in my programming journey.
